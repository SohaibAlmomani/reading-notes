# Application State with Redux

`State management` is absolutely critical in providing users with a well-crafted experience with minimal bugs.

`Redux` can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

`Redux` is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.

`Redux Toolkit` is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. `Redux Toolkit` builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.


`Redux Toolkit` is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:


```js 
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
````


### Redux Core
The Redux core library is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:
